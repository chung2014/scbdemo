# React Native App Sample Project

Make sure you have Node 8.3 or later installed. To run the project iOS app in simulator, you need to have Xcode installed.

## Development Environment I use are the following:

- Xcode 10.1
- node v8.12.0

The project is created with React Native CLI. Install it so that you can use the `react-native` command mentioned in the below How to run the project section.



## How to run the project

### iOS

- using the `react-native` command

```sh
$ npm i
$ react-native run-ios
```

- or open the Xcode project `scbdemo.xcodeproj` inside the ios/ directory and run it in Xcode.
